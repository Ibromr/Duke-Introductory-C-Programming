Welcome to the Practice Programming Environment.

THIS IS STILL IN PROGRESS.

This repository contains my projects and exercises from the Duke University Introductory C Programming Specialization. The specialization aims to build strong programming fundamentals by teaching systematic algorithm development and C code implementation across four courses.

Projects include implementing sorting algorithms and a multi-part Monte Carlo simulation to calculate poker hand probabilities, progressively increasing in complexity.
